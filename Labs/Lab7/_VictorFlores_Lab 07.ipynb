    "## Lab Objective:\n",
    "Create a Python script that recursively searches a file system for files with identical names. Perform a comparison on files and output the file paths of identical files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required tasks\n",
    "1. A menu\n",
    "    - this should be fairly easy seeing as your games (should) already have a menu system\n",
    "2. Recursive Search\n",
    "    - a recursive search is a search that will travle into a folder and back out.\n",
    "3. Comparison\n",
    "    - I recomend using a check sum comparison operation like MD5 or SHA-256\n",
    "4. Output\n",
    "    - the program will output files and there directories \n",
    "        - this can be done live or after\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions:\n",
    "Submit the file as a .py show it running in a .ipynb file\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Please find some sample code below to get you started\n",
